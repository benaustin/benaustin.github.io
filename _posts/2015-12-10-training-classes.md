In my unending quest to learn as much as I can about web development so I can change careers I've been taking classes online. The first one I started was <a href="https://codermanual.com/">Coder Manual</a>. I found it on <a href="http://boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a> on sale so I gave it a try. I know a fair bit of basic web coding like HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript so the beginning was pretty boring. But now we're really hitting Ruby and Ruby on Rails pretty hard and it's very interesting how everything is working together. Learning how real websites actually work and how to make them look professional is always something I've struggled with. Until now my sites have always look like Geocities but now I could probably make one that looked like someone with an education made it.

The format is good and he's a good teacher but he sometimes glazes over complex subjects and says "We'll go back to that later." Overall I'm enjoying it and this is the first project we made through it. It is pretty basic and it doesn't do much of anything but it's a start. It is a social media site that allows developers to connect with business people with a free and premium level of subscription. This is where it is <a href="https://still-wave-9397.herokuapp.com">still-wave-9397.herokuapp.com</a>. I kinda wish we could work on a Portfolio or something but there you go.

I have a bunch of other development classes purchased and ready to go so I'm looking forward to the future.
