I created a Git Hub user site because I felt it was easy to use and largely recognizable and I'd be using Git a lot in my travels and it's free so what the hell. Git Hub is a social code repository used for people to share their code. I've used it in the past for random stuff and when I was trying out different coding languages.
## Jekyll Bootstrap
I created my site and thought I'd throw a blog on it. Git Hub recommends Jekyll so that's what I'll setup and use for my blog. I started Googling around to find an easy way to install Jekyll and get it setup. I found <a hrref="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> which was very straight forward and easy to use. I created my Git user page repository and cloned the Jekyll Bootstrap reposity and I was ready to run. 

The website is pretty old but everything seems to be working ok and I can update it so we'll go with it untill I figure more stuff out and we can change it.
## Welcome
So as my first post comes to a close... come along with me on my journey from not know at all what I'm doing to maybe getting a job as a developer.
